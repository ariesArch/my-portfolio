### What PHP Is and Isn't

- **Server-Side Scripting Language**: PHP excels in orchestrating server operations, including complex storage and retrieval tasks.
- **HTML Embedding Compatibility**: Its syntax within web documents is reminiscent of HTML, interleaving with the content for seamless integration.
- **Not Purely Object-Oriented**: While it now supports object-oriented programming paradigms, it continues to offer primarily procedural constructs.
